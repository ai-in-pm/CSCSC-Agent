    "crew_output": "Here are the updated EVM metrics accounting for environmental factors:\n\nFor 'E001' - Heavy Rainfall: \n- EV: Decreases due to delays in tasks T003 and T004.\n- PV: Remains constant since it's based on the original plan.\n- AC: Increases due to costs of water pumps and drying facilities as well as overtime.\n- With high severity and high likelihood, risk exposure is HIGH. The SV (EV-PV) will be negative, signaling a delay. The CV (EV-AC) will also be negative, signaling cost overruns. SPI (EV/PV) and CPI (EV/AC) will be less than 1, suggesting poor performance against the plan.\n\nFor 'E002' - Unexpected Rock Formation: \n- EV: Decreases due to potential delays in task T003.\n- PV: Remains constant.\n- AC: Increases due to costs of additional excavation equipment.\n- With high severity and medium likelihood, risk exposure is MEDIUM. Again, SV and CV will be negative, and SPI and CPI will be less than 1, suggesting cost and schedule overruns.\n\nFor 'E003' - Additional Permits Required: \n- EV: Decreases due to potential delays in tasks T007 and T008.\n- PV: Remains constant.\n- AC: Increases due to costs of permit applications and potential penalties.\n- With high severity and high likelihood, risk exposure is HIGH. SV and CV will be negative, and SPI and CPI will be less than 1, suggesting cost and schedule overruns.\n\nThis is a high-level estimate of how the EVM metrics may change due to these environmental factors. A detailed quantitative analysis would require additional project data.  Implementing recommended mitigation strategies can help improve these values by reducing the severity and likelihood of these risks. Regular performance reviews are crucial in the previously mentioned strategies. It ensures that the project is constantly adjusting to new information and mitigating environment-related risks. Without these strategies, project progression might suffer.",
